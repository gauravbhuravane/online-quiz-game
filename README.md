## ▶️ How to Run the Project

> ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Since the project fetches data from a local `questions.json` file, you **must use a local server** to run it. Otherwise, the browser will block the JSON request due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy.

### ✅ Recommended Method: Use Live Server (VS Code)

1. **Install Live Server Extension** in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl + Shift + X)
   - Search for "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey
   - Click **Install**

2. **Open the Project Folder** in VS Code

3. **Right-click `index.html`** and choose:

4. The quiz app will launch in your default browser, typically at:http://127.0.0.1:5500/

5. Now you can play the quiz by selecting a category and difficulty level!
